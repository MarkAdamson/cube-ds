A Kick-Ass Rubik's Cube Game for Nintendo DS

Controls
========
Rotate the cube when it is on the lower screen using the stylus.
To twist segments of the cube, hold L or R, then touch and drag
any part of the cube.

In Painter mode, painting the cube squares different colours works
in the same way as twisting during normal play.
